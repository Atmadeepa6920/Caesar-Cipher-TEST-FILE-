Text Encryption Using Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher: 
The Caesar Cipher, originating from Julius Caesar, is an ancient and rudimentary substitution cipher. It functions by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For instance, with a shift value of 3, 'A' becomes 'D.' While it serves as an educational tool to grasp basic encryption concepts, it is unsuitable for modern security. This cipher has only 25 possible keys (shift values) and is susceptible to brute-force attacks. Additionally, its encrypted text retains letter frequency patterns, making it vulnerable to frequency analysis. Despite its limitations, the Caesar Cipher remains relevant in educational and historical contexts.

Programming Language used: To encrypt a text, C language is used here.
